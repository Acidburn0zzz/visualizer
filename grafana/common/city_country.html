<div id="city_country_text">
  <p>
    A restriction of the MaxMind database used to generate this graph
    is that certain client locations (AS subnets) are only linked with
    a country, not a specific city.
  </p>
  <p>
    These client locations are plotted on the map using the
    latitude/longitude of the capital of the country, but
    are listed in the table under the country name. Hence
    the table contains a mixture of country and city names.
