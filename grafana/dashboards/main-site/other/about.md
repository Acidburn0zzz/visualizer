## About

DNS-STATS Visualizer is a system which can

* Consume DNS traffic data files recorded in Compacted-DNS (C-DNS, RFC8618) format from nameservers. (Files in C-DNS format can be generated by [DNS-STATS
compactor](https://github.com/dns-stats/compactor/wiki).)

* Populate a ClickHouse database with per query/response level data (and additionally aggregate data at a chosen time interval)

* Produce [DCS](https://www.dns-oarc.net/tools/dsc)-like statistics graphs of the recorded traffic in Grafana.

RSSAC reports can also be made available via the link at the foot of the main dashboard.

The project was initially developed for for [ICANN](http://www.icann.org/) by [Sinodun IT](http://sinodun.com/), and is now released via [DNS-STATS](http://dns-stats.org) as an open source project licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0.
